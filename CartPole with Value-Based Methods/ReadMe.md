<!-- Run the experiments:


To run the Naive model, execute python "Naive.py".



***Ablation Study

For the ablation study to find the best learning rate, run python "Studylearnignrate.py"

To find the best update-to-data ratio, execute python "updateratio.py".

For determining the best network size, run python "networksize.py".

To find the best epsilon decay, execute python "decay3.py".

*************

To run the Experience Replay model, use python "ER99.py".

For the Target Network model, run python "Tn1000.py".

to run the combined Experience Replay and Target Network model, use python "ER+Tn.py".
 
to plot all the models combined run "4plot.py" after running all the 4 models individually -->
